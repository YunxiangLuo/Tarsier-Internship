Job for yppasswdd.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status yppasswdd.service" and "journalctl -xeu yppasswdd.service" for details.

At this point, we have to construct a list of the hosts which will run NIS
servers.  openEuler-riscv64 is in the list of NIS server hosts.  Please continue to add
the names for the other hosts, one per line.  When you are done with the
list, type a <control D>.
	next host to add:  openEuler-riscv64
	next host to add:  	next host to add:  
The current list of NIS servers looks like this:

openEuler-riscv64
004

Is this correct?  [y/n: y]  We need a few minutes to build the databases...

openEuler-riscv64 has been set up as a NIS master server.

Now you can run ypinit -s openEuler-riscv64 on all slave server.
